# SkyCast

SkyCast is a high-performance, visually immersive weather dashboard built with React. It features real-time weather tracking, a precision solar cycle arc, advanced air quality monitoring (US EPA standard), and a dynamic background system that adapts to current weather conditions.

# 🚀 Features

Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches live temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and visibility from OpenWeatherMap.

Advanced AQI Monitor: Calculates and displays the Air Quality Index using the official US EPA standard (0-500 scale) with a detailed breakdown of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2).

Precision Solar Arc: A custom SVG-based visualization tracking the sun's exact position based on local sunrise/sunset times.

Dynamic Visuals: Immersive background effects (rain, snow, clouds, sun rays) that react to live weather conditions.

7-Day Forecast: Horizontal scrollable forecast for the upcoming week.

Geolocation Support: Automatically detects user location on startup.

Demo Mode: Fully functional simulation mode for testing UI features without an API key.
